# gateway

The slice's only server (ADR-085): one Cloudflare Worker that serves the static React Router
build and a small Hono API under `/api` from the same origin, so there is one deploy, no CORS and
one allowed origin in WorkOS (ADR-086).

## What it does

- `GET /api/health` answers `{ "ok": true }`.
- `POST /api/messages` takes `{ system, messages }` (`src/contract.ts`) and:
  - answers 401 `{ "error": "unauthorized" }` unless `Authorization: Bearer <token>` carries a
    WorkOS AuthKit access token that verifies against WorkOS's public keys (`src/auth.ts`);
  - answers 400 `{ "error": "invalid request" }` when the body does not match the schema; any
    other field, such as `model`, is dropped;
  - streams the reply from `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` through OpenRouter's Anthropic-compatible
    Messages API (`src/upstream.ts`, ADR-146; `max_tokens` 8192 as a cost cap, reasoning
    included) as `application/x-ndjson`: one Messages API stream event per line, exactly as the
    SDK's `MessageStream.toReadableStream()` writes it. The browser reads it back with
    `MessageStream.fromReadableStream(response.body)`;
  - answers 502 `{ "error": "upstream", "status": <number | null> }` when OpenRouter refuses the
    request, without the upstream body or the key.
- `POST /api/playground` takes the playground's history (`playgroundRequestSchema` in
  `@yaklabs/catalog/playground`), behind the same token check, and runs the tool loop for
  `/playground` (ADR-155):
  - the prompt and the tool loop live here, never in the browser (`src/playground.ts`); the
    five tool definitions are shared schema from `@yaklabs/catalog/playground`;
  - each round's tool calls are checked with the catalog's own validators; a bad call goes back
    to the model as an error result and never reaches the page (`src/playgroundTools.ts`). A
    tool whose input fails twice is retired for the rest of the turn: the next round no longer
    offers it, and a call to it anyway is refused flat (ADR-157);
  - the reply streams as `application/x-ndjson`, one `PlaygroundEvent` per line, from `start`
    to `end`, with `seq` counting up without a gap;
  - text is prose from its first delta and is never relabelled; progress reaches the page only
    as `update_work` labels, and a turn that stops at a limit or loses the model says why in
    `end`'s `line` (protocol 2);
  - a turn stops at 8 rounds; tool calls past 16 in a turn get an error result instead of
    running, and a refused first round answers 502 like `/api/messages`.
- Every other path is a static file from `apps/web/build/client`; a path that is not a file gets
  `index.html`, and the app's router takes it from there. The Worker runs only for `/api/*`.
- It stores nothing and logs no conversation content.

The code: `src/worker.ts` is the Workers entry, which reads the bindings and builds the app once
per isolate; `src/app.ts` is the route table (`AppType`, for Hono's typed client); `src/auth.ts`
verifies tokens.

## Local development

```sh
cp apps/gateway/.dev.vars.example apps/gateway/.dev.vars   # then fill in both values
pnpm --filter web build                                    # the static site the Worker serves
pnpm --filter gateway dev                                  # http://localhost:8787
```

`wrangler dev` serves the last web build, so rebuild the web app to see UI changes there.
`.dev.vars` is ignored by git and supplies both bindings locally.

```sh
pnpm --filter gateway test        # vitest in node: routes, streaming, auth
pnpm --filter gateway typecheck
pnpm --filter gateway build       # wrangler deploy --dry-run into dist/, deploys nothing
```

The build bundles the web build as the Worker's assets, so `apps/web/build/client` must exist:
run `pnpm --filter web build` first. The root `pnpm build` orders the two through Turbo.

## Secrets and variables

| Binding              | Production                                           | Local       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | secret: `wrangler secret put`, or a dashboard Secret | `.dev.vars` |
| `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`   | variable: a dashboard Text variable                  | `.dev.vars` |

The OpenRouter key's own credit limit is the slice's spending cap (ADR-146): OpenRouter refuses
the key once it is spent, and the gateway answers 502 with that status.

Nothing environment-specific is written in `wrangler.jsonc`: `keep_vars` is on, so a deploy keeps
the dashboard's variables (a value named under `vars` would replace them), and secrets survive
deploys anyway. Until both values are set, every `/api/*` request fails with a 500 while the
static site keeps working, and the Worker's logs name each missing or malformed binding (never
its value); the client id must start with `client_`.

Token checks accept the issuers WorkOS's hosted API mints: `https://api.workos.com` for older
environments and `https://api.workos.com/user_management/<clientId>` for ones created since
mid-2025. A custom auth domain mints its own issuer, which `src/auth.ts` would need to accept.

## Logs

`observability` is on in `wrangler.jsonc`, so Cloudflare keeps an invocation log per request
(method, URL, response status, timing) beside the Worker's own console records. The new failure
records reach production after deployment; `wrangler dev` prints console records locally.

- Stored logs: Cloudflare dashboard, Workers & Pages, `yaklabs`, Observability, Events. Filter
  by `event` to find the gateway's records. Invocations shows the requests themselves.
- Live logs: `pnpm --filter gateway exec wrangler tail` streams the deployed Worker's requests
  and records as they happen. The gateway answers its own failures, so they show as records
  on an `ok` invocation, not under `--status error`.

The gateway logs four records, each a plain object Workers Logs indexes by field:

| Record                                                                  | Level | When                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{ event: "upstream_failure", status }`                                 | warn  | OpenRouter refuses `/api/messages` or a playground's first round |
| `{ event: "playground_round_failed", cause: "upstream", status }`       | warn  | a later round is refused, or the upstream fails mid-round        |
| `{ event: "playground_round_failed", cause: "internal", status: null }` | error | a bug in the playground loop ends the turn early                 |
| `{ event: "gateway_error" }`                                            | error | any other error a route throws; it answers a bare 500            |

`status` is the upstream's HTTP status, or `null` when there is none (a dropped connection, an
error event mid-stream). These records contain no error message or stack, headers, token, key,
body or turn. Cloudflare's invocation log still contains the request path; query-string
redaction is enabled for logs and traces. Never put credentials or conversation contents in
URLs. Browser cancellation in the playground loop does not emit a failure record.

### Playground turn summaries

Each valid, authorized playground turn emits one `info` record named `playground_turn` when
the loop closes, including first-round refusals and observed cancellation:

```json
{ "event": "playground_turn", "outcome": "answered", "rounds": 2, "elapsedMs": 500 }
```

`outcome` reuses the streamed terminal reason: `answered`, `asked`, `limit`, or `upstream`.
An empty answer or broken round is `upstream`, matching what the browser receives. A turn
cancelled before a terminal decision is `cancelled`; an unexpected exception that escapes the
loop is `internal`. Cancellation after a terminal decision does not relabel that outcome.
Malformed or unauthorized requests never start a turn and do not emit a summary.

`rounds` counts attempted tool-loop rounds, including refusals, but not SDK retries or the
separate thinking-summary requests. `elapsedMs` measures gateway wall time through the terminal
decision or cancellation. It is neither CPU time nor the time until the browser paints the reply.
The record contains no conversation content or identifiers. Cloudflare supplies invocation
context, so no request IDs are threaded through the loop.

Filter Events on the `event` field for `playground_turn`, even on HTTP 200 invocations.
These are gateway-observed outcomes, not proof of client delivery; a terminated Worker may not
emit a final record.

### Sampled native traces

`observability.traces` enables Cloudflare's automatic tracing at a 5% invocation sample, while
the existing log capture remains unchanged. It needs no SDK or extra application spans. Once
deployed, open Observability, Traces to inspect outbound model requests, KV calls, and Worker
timing. A sampled invocation can contain several spans; 5% is not a per-round sampling rate.
At low traffic, seeing no trace after a few requests is expected. Seven-day trace retention
and sampling make this a diagnostic view, not a complete count of turn outcomes.

Native traces collect more metadata than our allowlisted console records. Cloudflare's
documented fetch attributes include URLs, selected content and accept headers, status codes,
and body sizes, not body contents or Authorization headers. `redact_query_string` removes
query strings from logged and traced request URLs, not paths or explicitly logged text.
Handler spans also include user-agent and geographic metadata. KV spans can include keys and
metadata; for our shares, that includes expiration and the revocation hash, but not the raw
revoke token or sealed thread bytes. Do not put secrets or conversation contents in URLs or
KV metadata.

Review sampled production attributes before treating the setup as privacy-verified. A local
dry-run validates the configuration but cannot prove what the managed trace collector stores.
Disable `observability.traces.enabled` and redeploy to stop trace collection without disabling
logs. Cloudflare's [tracing docs][cf-traces] and [attribute reference][cf-attrs] describe
collection,
retention, and pricing; trace sampling does not sample the summary logs.

## Deploy with Workers Builds

Create the Worker from the GitHub repository (Workers & Pages, Create, Import a repository). The
Worker's name in the dashboard must be `yaklabs`, the `name` in `wrangler.jsonc`, or the build
fails. Then set, under Settings, Build:

| Setting        | Value                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Root directory | `apps/gateway`              |
| Build command  | `pnpm --filter web build`   |
| Deploy command | `pnpm exec wrangler deploy` |

Builds installs the workspace's dependencies before the build command runs. Its image ships
pnpm 10.11.1, older than the `pnpm@10.33.0` this repo pins and the `allowBuilds` setting in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so add a build variable (Settings, Build, Variables and secrets):

- `PNPM_VERSION` = `10.33.0`

And two runtime values (Settings, Variables and Secrets):

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, type Secret: the OpenRouter API key
- `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`, type Text: the WorkOS client id (public; the browser carries it too)

Add the deployed address to WorkOS's redirect URIs (`https://<worker>/callback`) and CORS
origins (ADR-084), and build the web app with `VITE_AUTH=workos`, `VITE_WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` and
`VITE_WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` set as build variables (`apps/web/README.md`).
