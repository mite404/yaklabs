// toggle, and a peek over the workspace leaves them there. Docking or closing eases this width
// over the panel's own 250ms, on the same curve (index.css), so the two edges move as one, and like
// the panel it moves at once for a key, a drag or reduced motion. On a phone it stands aside and
// the bar's grid places the toggle itself (ADR-116).
