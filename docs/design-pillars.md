# Design pillars - the YakLabs visual language

Rules for building on-brand surfaces for Kay, reverse-engineered from yaklabs.ai and refined through
prototyping.
Each rule states what to do, then why.
Sources are marked: **css** (declared in yaklabs.ai's stylesheet), **derived** (our choice),
**Ethan** (Ethan's pick), **estimated** (a guess awaiting confirmation).
No brand colour is sampled from screenshots or recordings: the screen used had a blue-light filter,
and filters and colour profiles shift pixels (ADR-051).
Decisions behind these rules live in `docs/adr/adr.md` (ADR-033 to ADR-035); tokens live in
`packages/catalog/src/tokens.css`.

## Colour

The site is light only (ADR-161). The dark values in these rules belong to the catalog, whose
dark theme stays for its stories and the design tooling.

### 1. There is no black: neutrals are olive-tinted

Headings, body copy, and the "Apply for this role" button all share one olive-yellow hue (about
107° in OKLCH) at very low colour strength (chroma 0.002 to 0.009).
Near-black at that hue reads as a dark green-black; the lighter body copy reads as brown-green.
Never use pure `#000` or a cool grey for text.

### 2. Tinted neutrals only show their tint at large sizes

The same ink looks green-black in a 40px serif headline and plain black in 14px button text.
Large glyphs carry enough ink area for the hue to register; small text does not, and a dark outline
around it (as on the button) pushes it darker still.
Judge a tinted neutral at the size it will be used, never on a swatch.

### 3. Use the tinted ink only for display text

Apply a more visibly tinted ink (olive-leaning, e.g. `#22251e`) only to display text: Newsreader
headlines and thread titles, where the tint can actually be seen.
Keep the site's declared ink (`#252524`) and body grey (`#4a4a47`) for UI and body text, where extra
tint is invisible but can muddy contrast.
This mirrors the site itself: the headline reads green-black, the button reads black.

### 4. Body copy is a lighter step of the same ink

Headings use the ink; body copy is a solid grey at about 82% of it; meta text and outline borders
use the ink at 0.72.
Implement steps as solid colours (`color-mix`), not transparency, so text stays clean on tinted
surfaces.

### 5. Green comes from one hue family

The only green declared in the site's CSS is the sage `#c7cfba` (hue 124°); the UI accent `#515e38`
is derived on that same hue so buttons, charts, chips, and bubbles read as one family.
Darker greens are mixed from the declared near-black green `#111411` rather than picked from the
hero photo.

### 6. Every colour goes through a semantic token

Components use only named tokens, never raw hex. The core set uses yaklabs.ai's own names and values
(`--paper`, `--paper-deep`, `--ink`, `--soft-ink`, `--rule`, `--hairline`, `--blue`, `--sage`,
`--chalk`, `--moss`, `--rust`); colours the site does not declare carry a `--yak-` prefix, and roles
such as `--accent`, `--bubble-*`, and `--btn-*` are built on top.

### The site's contrast pattern: two inks, two lines

yaklabs.ai uses two text inks and two line weights, and nothing else: `--ink` for headings (13.3:1
on paper), `--soft-ink` for body and all secondary text (`#565650` from the site's brand.css,
6.4:1), `--rule` (ink at 72%) for strong lines and outlines (5.7:1), and `--hairline` (ink at 25%)
for borders and dividers.
We follow it exactly; a field's placeholder takes the rule's ink, one step greyer than body text,
and text selection is `--blue` with ink, as on the site.
The raw palette (`--yak-*`) exists only to feed the semantic layer, so rebranding is a one-block
edit.

### 16. Contrast is measured, never judged by eye

Text needs at least 4.5:1 and UI parts and graphics (rings, outlines, chart marks) at least 3:1,
checked against every surface the colour lands on, including hover, selected and dark mode.
A colour that fails is flagged with its ratio before it ships, even when it was asked for: six
colours that looked fine failed on measurement, most of them on the `#8a8a85` hover (ADR-065).

## Typography

### 7. Newsreader for display, Inter for everything else

Newsreader (serif, optical sizing) is for display moments: page headlines, the wordmark, thread
titles.
Inter (sans, optical sizing) is for interface and body text.
Both are bundled locally (SIL Open Font License) so they render offline in the desktop app.

## Buttons

### 8. The outline button is the default

At rest a button is only an outline; on hover the fill and text colour change over 150ms with the
default `ease` curve, and the border switches to the fill colour instantly (it is not in the
transition).

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Font | Inter, 14px, medium (500), normal letter-spacing | css |
| Padding | 10px × 22px (compact: 6px × 14px at 13px) | css / derived |
| Corners | 4px | css |
| Rest fill | transparent | css |
| Rest outline | 1px, ink at 0.72 (`rgba(37, 37, 36, 0.72)`) | css |
| Rest text | ink `#252524` | css |
| Hover fill | `--moss` (`#263b30`) | css (the site's hover rule) |
| Hover outline | `--moss`, switches instantly | css |
| Hover text | off-white `#f0efea` | css |
| Transition | `background-color 0.15s, color 0.15s` (border not animated) | css |
| Easing | `ease` (the default) | css |
| Delay | none | css |
| Focus | 2px accent outline, 2px offset | derived |
| Disabled | 45% opacity, no hover | derived |

### 17. A toggle never moves when its label flips

A button that switches between two labels keeps one whole-pixel width (128px, the widest label) and
shares a whole-pixel line with the text beside it, so nothing in the footer shifts between states,
not even by a rounded pixel (ADR-072).

### 9. A perceived delay is often just duration

The button seemed to pause before filling, but its CSS has no delay: a 150ms `ease` transition is
long enough to register as "a beat, then it arrives" rather than a snap.
Before adding a delay to make something feel deliberate, try a slightly longer duration; a real
delay makes a control feel unresponsive.
Around 100ms reads as instant, around 150 to 200ms reads as a soft arrival, and past about 300ms a
hover starts to feel sluggish.

### 27. A place outside the demo keeps its name, and says so

A place in the rail that this demo leaves out of scope stays in the rail, named in its pill and in
the phone drawer's row and reached by keyboard, but it opens nothing and says "Out of demo scope"
(Ethan; ADR-094, amended; ADR-144).
It is drawn in faint ink, never at reduced opacity: the 45% of a disabled button (rule 8) takes a
rail glyph to 2.0:1 on paper, under rule 16's 3:1.
It has no hover fill and no step to ink, since there is nothing to press, so the fill still means
"this opens something".
The rail checks' P23 and P25 measure all of this in both themes.

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glyph and name | `--faint-ink`, an archived row's: 5.17:1 on paper, 5.46:1 dark | derived |
| Hover | none: no fill, no step to ink, the arrow cursor | derived |
| Words | "Out of demo scope", the same in the pill, the drawer row and to a screen reader | Ethan |
| Pill | name, then "· Out of demo scope", `--on-ink` 72% over `--ink` (rule 4): 7.6:1, 6.9:1 | derived |
| Drawer row | the words after the name, 12px, as the thread count sits | derived |
| Screen reader | a button, `aria-disabled`, described by the words | derived |

## Data visualisation

### 10. Bars are flat

Bars are one flat data colour with the button's 4px top corners; the darker eased base they used to
have did not work with the colour scheme and was removed (ADR-055).
Chart marks and their legend keys are graphite `#56564f` (6.4:1 on paper), a warm neutral, so green
stays for button hovers (ADR-058).

### 12. Cards come to rest 20px above the compose box

The last card in a thread rests 20px above the compose box, or 20px above the card docked over it,
and any card that grows (a data table, "Show my work") is nudged to that same line instead of
opening underneath.
One resting line means the eye always finds new content in the same place, the way a lower third
always sits at the same height on screen.
This holds even for a card that grows taller than the view: its top scrolls off, because the bottom
edge is what tells the user the whole card has been shown (ADR-071).
The gap is the token `--rest-gap`; the thread's bottom padding subtracts the compose row's 4px
focus-ring inset (`--compose-inset`) so the visible gap is exactly 20px.

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resting gap | 20px (`--rest-gap`) | Ethan |
| Compose row inset | 4px (`--compose-inset`) | derived (fits the 3px focus ring) |
| Nudge | smallest scroll; never upward | derived (ADR-038) |

## Surfaces

### 13. Attention gets its own surface (light and dark)

The thread's cards all sit on paper, so anything that needs the user (the Recap, a "Needs you"
question) sits on the attention surface, a pale warm grey, and stands apart without a badge or a
colour of alarm.
Its choices are paper tiles, lighter than the card, so they separate by colour; hovering a row
darkens it to a mid grey, where the usual inks fail, so the hovered row's text switches to the
darkest ink.
Green appears only as a button hover: Submit fills with the site's moss, as the outline button does.
Both cards cast their shadow down and to the right, as if lit from the top left, and never on the
top or left edge (ADR-069).
The question card, labelled "Needs attention", is the exception: it sits on the app's paper with no
grey fill at rest, its options, header and Skip fill with `--paper-deep` only on hover, and its
label is a caution orange pill (ADR-067, ADR-068).

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surface (light) | `--attention-bg` (`#d6d5cf`), ink 10.4:1, soft-ink 4.6:1 | Ethan |
| Tiles (light) | `--tile-bg` (`--paper`), 1.3:1 against the card, soft-ink 5.8:1 | derived |
| Hover (light) | `--attention-hover` (`#8a8a85`), text to `#111411` at 5.4:1 | Ethan |
| Question card rest / hover | no fill / `--paper-deep` (`#e4e4df`), ink 12.0:1, soft-ink 5.8:1 | Ethan |
| Question label | `--yak-orange` (`#d19456`) with `--yak-brown-ink` (`#3b2612`), 5.5:1 | Ethan |
| Focus (light) | ink ring, 10.4:1 (the page's grey ring is 2.3:1 here) | derived |
| Surface (dark) | `#62625d`, paper text 5.3:1 | Ethan |
| Tiles (dark) | 18% night on the surface, paper 6.6:1 | derived |
| Hover (dark) | 50% night on the surface (`#3a3b37`), paper 9.8:1 | derived |

### 28. A hover label is an ink pill

Anything that names itself on hover or focus (a rail place, Unpin, a layout, Collapse all, a
sidebar row's cut name) does it in one look: the rail's ink pill, which Ethan kept ("it looks
great"), not shadcn's square box with an arrow.
There is one tooltip in `packages/ui` and it draws only this, so a new label cannot come out in
another shape.
The page's ink, turned over, stands out from the paper shell in either theme without a shadow.
Its corners are half a one-line pill's height, so one line is a capsule, and a name long enough to
wrap keeps the same ends instead of turning into a lozenge.
It waits for the pointer to rest, so passing over a row of icons does not flash a label at each,
and once one is up its neighbours open at once. It comes and goes as every popover does (rule
31).
Storybook has no story for it: Storybook holds the catalog's hand-made primitives, and this is
the vendored shadcn tooltip. P23 reads the rail's pills in both themes.

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fill / text | `--ink` / `--on-ink`: 13.3:1 light, 16.1:1 dark | derived (ADR-144) |
| Secondary words | `--on-ink` 72% over `--ink` (rule 4): 7.6:1, 6.9:1 | derived (ADR-144) |
| Type | Inter 13px, medium, 16px line, one line unless a name must wrap (up to 320px) | derived |
| Padding | 4px × 10px | derived |
| Corners | 12px: half the one-line pill's 24px, a capsule on one line | derived |
| Offset | 8px off its trigger, no arrow | derived (ADR-144) |
| Delay | 350ms of rest, then the next opens at once | derived (ADR-144) |
| Motion | in over 125ms, `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`, scale 0.97 and fade; out in 100ms | derived |
| Reduced motion | fades only, no scale | derived |

### 33. The design tooling seal is a gold medal with an ink ribbon

The welcome's link to the design tooling page (ADR-160) is a seal: a serrated gold disc with
"Yaklabs" over the top of its ring and "Seal of quality" under the bottom, and an ink ribbon
across its middle carrying the link's words, which runs past the seal on either side.
Gold is a metal, so the seal keeps one colour in either theme; only the ribbon turns over with
the ink. The words are on the ribbon, never on the gold, since they run off the seal onto the
paper, where the brown ink fails in the dark theme.
The seal is drawn (`design-tooling-seal.tsx`), never a picture, so it scales to any size and
takes its colours from tokens. On the welcome the medal, the ribbon and its words are one SVG,
so they grow and settle as one piece (Ethan): an HTML ribbon beside the SVG medal snapped its
words to whole font sizes and its edges to whole pixels on every frame of the hover, each part
landing at its own time.

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Face | `--seal-gold` (`--yak-orange`, `#d19456`), lit from the top left to `--seal-gold-glint` | derived (Ethan's example seal) |
| Edge | `--seal-gold-deep` (`--rust`, `#a86f36`): 3.5:1 on the light paper, 6.6:1 dark, so the silhouette clears 3:1 | derived |
| Ring words | `--on-seal` (`--yak-brown-ink`, `#3b2612`): 5.5:1 on the face, the orange pill's pair | derived (rule 13) |
| Ribbon | `--ink` with `--on-ink`, 230px × 27px across the 112px medal, notched 8px at both ends; 11px 600 upper case, "NOW WITH DESIGN TOOLING!", set to the 186px the 0.1em tracking gives, at geometric precision | derived (rule 28's pill) |
| Ribbon hover | fills `--moss` with `--on-accent` over 150ms `ease`, as the outline button | css (rule 8) |
| Size | 112px on the welcome, 200px on the page's hero; 36 teeth, 5 units deep in a 120-unit box | derived |
| Place on the welcome | pinned above the greeting at the column's right, aligned optically: the ribbon's far tip in line with the ink of the projects' "+", 8px inside the column, and its lowest corner 4px below the mark's circle; worked out in CSS from the tilt, the size and the ribbon's corners, so it holds when either changes; tilted 25° with the left side up, as a medal on a lapel; in the column's flow under 641px | Ethan (mockup) |
| Focus | the site's ring, 2px `--focus` 3px off, on the link's 4px corners | derived |
| Size on the welcome | 73.5% of the drawn 112px, by `scale`, so the words stay crisp; 5% up from 70% so the ring's "Seal of quality" reads | Ethan |
| Hop | every 4s: 6px up and back over 480ms, a 2px second hop, then still; on `transform` under the tilt, so it hops along its lean; none under reduced motion (rule 24) | Ethan |
| Hover and focus | grows 10% (`scale` 0.735 to 0.8085) over 150ms `ease`, the button's timing (rule 8), the hop held meanwhile; no growth under reduced motion | Ethan |

## Inputs

### 14. A place to type is outlined, and its prompt is greyer

A text field uses the outline button's 1px border and 4px corners, so it belongs to the same family
as the button and never reads as plain text.
Its placeholder is greyer than any statement around it, because a placeholder asks and a statement
tells; on the strong surface a faint recessed fill keeps that greyer placeholder above 4.5:1.

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Border | 1px, ink at 0.72 (as the button) | css |
| Corners | 4px | css |
| Padding | 5px × 10px, 13px text | derived |
| Placeholder (paper) | `--rule` (ink at 72%), 5.7:1 | css |
| Placeholder (strong) | 78% paper on a 12% night fill, 4.6:1 | derived |
| Border (strong) | 60% paper, 3.5:1 | derived |
| Hover and focus | border to full ink; focus adds the 2px ring | derived |

### 15. The sage tint means "you"

The user's bubble is the only place the sage-green tint appears, so it always means "this is what
you said"; chips, badges, and tags use the neutral wash.
The tokens are named `--bubble-tint`, `--bubble-tint-strong`, and `--bubble-line`, so the tint
cannot be reused by accident.

## Motion

Two kinds of motion, with two sets of rules: **feedback** answers a user's action (a hover, a
menu opening) and should be brief; **status** loops while the agent works and should feel steady.
The status glyphs live in `packages/catalog/src/motion.css` (Storybook: Motion), and the reasoning
behind each rule below is told in `docs/FOR_ETHAN.md`.

| Motion | Duration | Curve | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Button fill and text on hover (rule 8) | 150ms | `ease` | css |
| Menu opening | 120ms | `ease-out` | derived |
| Modal fade, then rise | 160ms, 200ms | `ease-out` | derived |
| A loading thread's "Opening ..." line | shown after 100ms | none, steps in | derived (rule 9) |
| The empty canvas's splash, arriving | 150ms fade in | `ease-out` | derived (ADR-113) |
| A new thread's welcome picture | none, arrives with its words | none | derived (the paintings) |
| The welcome's seal, hopping (rule 33) | 480ms of a 4s cycle, 6px then 2px | `ease-in-out` | Ethan |
| The welcome's seal, growing under the pointer (rule 33) | 150ms, 10% | `ease` | Ethan (rule 8) |
| Agent working glyph (wave, orbit) | 2000ms loop | `linear` fades | Ethan |
| Agent tree glyph | 2000ms loop | `linear` fades, `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)` scroll | Ethan |
| Sidebar peek slide, out and back (rule 26) | 220ms | `cubic-bezier(0.17, 1.02, 0.58, 1)` (`--panel-ease`) | Ethan |
| Sidebar peek out, the panel's strength | none: full strength from the first frame, as a pin | none | Ethan |
| Sidebar peek fade back, to the slide's end | 120ms | `cubic-bezier(0.68, 0, 0.77, 0)` | derived |
| Sidebar rows, leaving on a peek's way back or an unpin | 60ms (`--rows-leave`), at 0 by the curve's 75% mark | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` | derived (Ethan) |
| Sidebar rows, a pointer turning a peek back mid-way | 120ms | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` | derived |
| The peek's edge through a pin from a peek | held, then off at the pin's last frame (a 0s step after `--panel-pin`) | none, steps | Ethan |
| The rail's divider through a pin and an unpin | on at the pin's first frame; off at the unpin's last (a 0s step after `--panel-pin`) | none, steps | Ethan |
| Sidebar pin and unpin (the panel behind the rail, workspace and tabs in step) | 250ms (`--panel-pin`); none under reduced motion (rule 24) | `cubic-bezier(0.17, 1.02, 0.58, 1)` (`--panel-ease`) | Ethan |
| Sidebar peek under reduced motion (rule 24) | none: no slide and no fade | none | Ethan |

### 18. A working indicator reads as steady work, never an alert

Status loops run at 2000ms and include a rest: all motion fits in the first 65% of a shape's
cycle, and the rest of the loop is still (Ethan). The orbit is the one exception: a circle has
no end to rest at, so its steadiness comes from an even pace instead.
An alarm never pauses; a rest is what separates "busy" from "look at me".
The first sketch ran at 150ms, about seven loops a second, and read as flicker; 2000ms was
chosen after comparing 1500 to 2500ms side by side.

### 19. Colour follows opacity: solid is darkest

A shape at full opacity is the darkest green on the surface; as it fades it lightens, so the tints
come from transparency, not from extra colours (Ethan).
In dark mode the ramp flips, so "solid" still means the most contrast against the paper.
Use only brand greens: moss, yak-green, sage, the chrome greens, and `color-mix` blends of them.
Where a loop should feel alive rather than mechanical, draw each flash's shade from a set of
seven, change it only while the shape is invisible (one shade per flash, never a smear), and keep
neighbours on different shades (Ethan; the wave glyph).

### 20. One clock per glyph; offsets, never a second track

Every shape in a glyph plays the same keyframes from one `--working-duration`, offset by delays,
so changing the duration can never pull them out of step (derived).
Write offsets as negative delays (a head start), so the first frame is never blank.
A second animation is allowed only for a different property on the same clock, such as the
wave's shade track, which runs a whole number of loops.

### 21. Things that move together travel the same distance on the same curve

When two shapes move as one (the tree's base leaving as its top branch arrives), give them equal
distance, equal duration and the same easing; a 3px move beside a 4px one tears the illusion
apart halfway (Ethan).
When one of them enters clear and clipped, let it lead: start the leaving shape a third of the
way into the entry (the tree's base waits 8% of the loop, 160ms), so the arrival is already
visible when the other starts to go. Started on the same frame, the solid shape reads as leaving
first and the arrival as late (Ethan, picked from three cues side by side).
Use `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)` (a symmetric ease-in-out) for moves, and `linear` for fades
inside a loop.
Write the curve out in each keyframe: `animation-timing-function` in a keyframe ignores `var()`
and silently falls back to `ease`.

### 22. Scroll through the frame; clip, never shrink

A shape leaves or enters by sliding past the glyph's edge and being clipped (`overflow: hidden`),
the way film passes a camera gate; the icon's footprint never changes (Ethan).
Move only what is lit: a shape nobody can see does not need to travel, and resets while invisible.
Direction reads from asymmetry, not colour: a fast rise and a long fall show which way a light is
travelling (the orbit), a symmetric fade does not.

### 23. Glyphs are 12px and live on whole pixels

Status glyphs keep the icon's 12px box in every variant, so swapping one for another never shifts
the text beside it (derived).
Every edge, gap and offset is a whole CSS pixel: 1.5px gaps rendered as 2px and 1px on the same
glyph; 3px squares or pills with 1px gaps are the small-size grid.
Round a 3px shape by at most half a pixel, or it turns into a plus sign.

### 24. Reduced motion holds a still frame that still reads as busy

Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, loops stop and hold a half-lit frame (some shapes solid,
some at 0.55), never a blank or a spinner that looks broken (derived).
Feedback transitions drop to 0ms.
A status glyph is an `<output>` with an `aria-label`, so it is announced once, not on every frame.

### 25. Motion is judged frame by frame, and proved by measurement

Every motion ships with a Speeds story (the same loop at several durations, side by side) and is
checked on a contact sheet: the loop paused at even steps.
Timing claims ("half clipped as the branch is half faded", "no two squares share a shade") get a
browser test that seeks the animation and measures it; a screenshot of one good frame proves
little, since each frame of a broken loop can look fine on its own.

### 26. A panel slides back the way it slid out, and the rail's edge clips it

The projects panel's peek slides out from behind the rail's edge and back behind it on one curve
and one duration, 220ms both ways, and a pin or an unpin by the toggle moves on the same curve
over 250ms (Ethan). The curve is a fast acceleration into a long, smooth settle, fitted to the
value graph of Ethan's After Effects example: `cubic-bezier(0.17, 1.02, 0.58, 1)`,
`--panel-ease` in `index.css`. It covers half its travel by 13% of the time and 90% by 43%, and
the rest of the time is the settle.
The stage beside the rail clips the panel at the rail's edge (`overflow: clip`, never `hidden`,
so no focus or scroll into view can scroll it), the way rule 22's shapes pass their gate: the
panel never covers the rail's places, and the fade hides no motion (derived, ADR-144).
Out, it slides at full strength from the first frame, as a pin does, its edge's hairline and
shadow drawn at once (Ethan); a fade-in let the workspace's border show through it and drew the
panel's edge slowly. Back, it keeps full strength and fades over the slide's last 120ms,
starting 100ms in, on the strong ease-out played backwards (derived): still 0.97 when its edge
is 2px from home.
Its rows go first, as a title's type goes before its bar, on a peek's way back and on an unpin
alike: they fade from the first frame on the strong ease-out and are at 0 once the panel has
covered three quarters of its way home (60ms, the curve's 75% mark at 27% of the peek's 220ms),
so no row is left as the panel lands (Ethan). The paper and its edge stay solid, so the slide
still reads. Opening, the rows are there from the first frame.
A pin while the panel peeks moves only the workspace, sliding under the panel: the peek's edge
holds through it until the workspace's rounded border is under it (Ethan).
Docked by the toggle, the line that parts the rail from the panel is the rail's own right edge,
not the panel's left: it is there on the pin's first frame, the panel sliding out from behind
it, and it stays through an unpin until the panel is home (Ethan). A line on the panel's edge
would sit behind the clip until the last frame and creep in as the curve settles, like a fade.
That tail fade takes away only the soft shadow and the hairline across the workspace's corner,
which would otherwise vanish in one frame as the panel lands: 2.5% of the 40px strip past the
rail's edge in either theme, the landing frame at full strength against rest (derived).
The first way back faded on the slide's own front-loaded curve over 160ms: at 0.32 after 33ms,
with its edge still 83px out, it read as no motion at all.
The sidebar checks' P24 seeks both directions to the same instants, holds them to this and
measures that share; P29 and P30 hold the rail still, and its edge its own, at every such frame.

### 31. A popover comes and goes in half the drawer's slide, and takes no pointer on its way out

Every popover, the ink pill and the menus, opens and closes in 110ms, half the projects drawer's
220ms, on the drawer's curve, `cubic-bezier(0.17, 1.02, 0.58, 1)` (Ethan). The two are one
family of motion: the drawer slides, its popovers answer at double speed on the same curve.
It leaves by a transition, never a keyframe, so a popover reopened while it fades turns back
from where it is rather than finishing its exit first; and while it fades it takes no pointer,
so the row under the cursor is the page's, never a ghost's (derived). Bonsai's own hover cards,
which linger and stay live while they fade, are the example of what this rule refuses.
A dismissal is not instant: Base UI marks Escape and a click outside `data-instant`, and the
menus keep their transition through it. Measured in Chromium: the bell's menu reads 0 opacity
and `pointer-events: none` from the first frame after Escape, is gone at 104ms, and a reopen at
25ms turns back from 0.09.

### 32. An activity line says what was done, and nothing fancy

A line that reports the agent's work is a verb and its object: "Read skill bro", "Explored 1
skill", "Reading the support records", "Checked workload, open issues and response times"
(Ethan, after Claude Code's own rows). Present tense while it runs, past once it is done, a count
where there are several, the object named as the reader knows it. No adverbs, no "successfully",
no tool names unless the tool is the object, no theatre ("Analyzing your request…"), no full stop
on a label. A child's placeholder is "Working", a reply's before any words "Thinking". The
disclosure's header (rule 30) and the recap's items are held to this; the technical lines one
fold down may be as technical as they like.

## Verification workbench exceptions

The Pixels workbench uses neon green (`#39ff14`) for changed pixels. Comparator proof uses red
(`#ff0000`) for its deliberately introduced mistakes (Ethan). These diagnostic colors are not
product status colors. Their roles live in `tools/verify-ui-drift/src/diff-palette.ts`; grayscale
supplies
unchanged context. Older evidence keeps its original overlay color rather than rewriting artifacts.

Workbench density uses five-sixths of `--space` for its primary spacing, about 17% less than the
24px token (derived from Ethan's request for roughly 15% more room). The viewer height is 17 times
`--space`, or 408px. Typography keeps the existing 12px annotations and 13px compact controls;
display sizes use 28px for the heading and 24px for the selected component. Image zoom and the 4×
inspector are not scaled with the surrounding interface (derived).
The Pixels results list displays up to ten complete rows before scrolling (Ethan). Its height
follows
the rendered rows so source-path wrapping and font changes do not hide entries (derived).

### 29. Quiet prose: one reading treatment, streaming or finished

Every agent reply renders through the catalog's own prose component (ADR-140, ADR-147), never a
Markdown renderer's defaults, and the same rules hold while the words stream and after they
finish, so nothing restyles as a reply completes. Emphasis is authored, never inferred: a mark on
a run of text, set as `<strong>`, `<em>` or `<code>`.

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Body | Inter 15px on a 24px line, `--soft-ink` | Ethan (Candidate A) |
| Paragraph gap | 16px | Ethan |
| Heading | body size, 600, `--ink`, 32px above and 4px below | Ethan |
| Emphasis | 600 in `--ink`; italics from Inter's own italic cut, `font-synthesis: none` | Ethan |
| Measure | 510px for text; a card between paragraphs takes the thread's 80ch | Ethan |
| Card between paragraphs | 16px above and below | derived (the paragraph gap) |
| Code | 13px on 20px, ui-monospace, on `--paper-deep`, 3px corners | derived |
| Narration under a streaming reply | 13px on 20px, `--soft-ink`, the working glyph before it | derived (ADR-139) |
| A reply that stopped short | its label in 600 `--ink`, why in `--soft-ink`, a 2px `--hairline` rule at the left | derived (ADR-139) |
| A limitation in the words | reads as prose, never a warning colour: the sentence in the body's `--soft-ink`, the request it offers quoted in `--ink`, then the compact outline button (`.btn .btn-sm`) that sends it, held while a reply streams and absent where nothing can be sent; the stopped reply's 2px `--hairline` rule at the left, 16px inset and 8px between parts; the paragraph gap around it, the text's 510px measure | derived (ADR-147, widened; the row above) |

### 30. The answered surface, the folded request and the running status

Three surfaces the legibility demo added, all built from the thread's own tokens (ADR-142,
ADR-150).

| Property | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Answered surface | `--paper`, 1px `--hairline`, 12px corners, 12px 16px padding | Ethan (screenshot) |
| Question over answer | 13px on 20px `--soft-ink`, then 15px on 24px 500 `--ink`, 2px apart; pairs 12px apart | derived |
| Folded request | eight lines (192px), a fade over the last 48px, Show more in 13px `--soft-ink` to `--ink` over 150ms | Ethan (screenshot) |
| Running status by the compose box | paper, `--hairline`, 8px corners, 13px on 20px, shown 48px or more above the end | derived (ADR-142) |
| Child footnote | 12px `--soft-ink`; the Running pill in `--bubble-tint-strong` with `--bubble-line`, 11px 500 | Ethan (ADR-142) |
| The disclosure above the reply | 13px 500, its chevron first, mounted as the work starts; live, the working glyph then the activity; settled, the reply's summary or Work finished, incomplete, Stopped; its count in 12px `--soft-ink` beside the label ("3 checks · 1 needs attention") | Ethan (ADR-139, amended) |
| Basis lines under a step's outcome | how the outcome was found, in a few lines between the outcome and its evidence card: 13px on 20px `--soft-ink`, disc bullets at the earlier narration's 22px indent, the prose's 510px measure, so the outcome stays the loudest line of the row | derived (ADR-147, widened; the narration row in pillar 29) |
| Lane collapse toggle | a 20px fill, 13px glyph, `--leading-space` (7px) inside the lane's 1px border, the inset the collapsed strip gives its expand; `--leading-gap` (14px) from the fill to the title, so the glyph's ink sits 20px from the title's first letter, as the bar's Share icon sits from its Close; centred on the title's capitals (cap top to baseline), 2px above its line box; the same on a card lane's heading | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Collapsed strip | the expand at its head and the lane's close at its foot, each a 20px fill with a 13px glyph 7px inside the border; the grip and the title between, with equal paper either side of the grip, about 13.5px ink to ink; the title's first letter starts just under an open lane's title-bar rule (55.5px down), so one line runs across open lanes and strips | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Title-bar grip | six 2.5px dots in `--soft-ink` on a 5px pitch, on the collapse's line (the title's capitals, 2px above the bar's middle); over an 86px veil of the bar's paper, solid for its middle 47px so faded letters stop 16px either side of the dots; only a 50px circle about the dots, 25px every way from their centre, shows the hand, wakes the dots and veil, and takes the lane, so neither the hand nor the dots show on the way to the collapse, "⋯", Share or Close, or near the bar's edges; the circle is a clip, not a radius, which would round the dots' own box and shave its corner dots; the veil only paints; the grip stays up on a lane's or a card's picture in flight | Ethan |
| Thread menu | one list for a tab and a lane's title bar: Copy thread URL, Share thread; a rule; Rename, Pin, Snooze, Archive; a rule; Delete. A phone's bar, with no title to rename, has no Rename | Ethan (ADR-126) |
| Canvas grid | every lane, strip, gap and the drop zone is a whole number of 18px steps, so each gap's column of dots sits centred between its lanes; a default lane is 31 steps, or as many as fit, rounded down; the drop zone is a default lane wide | Ethan (ADR-158) |
| Search marks | every match tinted `--blue` at 40%, the one stepped to in `--blue` with `--on-blue` words (`--yak-night`, 8.0:1 in both themes, as text selection now is), as a text selection (`::highlight()`); a 2px `--blue` ring with a 5px halo around its words alone, widening and fading over 1.2s on the strong ease-out; reduced motion holds the 2px ring | Ethan (ADR-158) |
| Cut sidebar title | fades to nothing over its last 24px (`--space`) instead of an ellipsis; a title that fits keeps every letter | Ethan (ADR-158) |
| Rail place fill | the hover and open fill takes the site's 4px button corners (`--radius`), as a sidebar row's does | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Play callout | each visit to a demo's thread that is not playing rings Play once in the canvas's lane flash: 3px `--olive`, fading over 1.2s, on the button's own corners; reduced motion holds the ring | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| An answer given for the user | a demo shows it as a hand would: the tile hovered (700ms at 1x), selected (600ms), then Submit pressed (180ms: the moss hover fill and scale 0.96, which a real press gets too), then sent | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Jump framing | a target already wholly in view does not move, and only its glow says where it is; a user's message out of view lands centred; anything else out of view scrolls just into view, its top never cut off | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Reveal after a press | a control that opens something keeps itself in view: the thread rises to show what opened, and stops once the control reaches the top of the band | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Resize hint | full `--ink` for 40px either side of the pointer, gone by 70px | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Splash | each visit takes the next look: abstract, landscape, Vitruvian, then round again; the switch lists them in that order, then Bonsai | Ethan (ADR-159) |
| Kay's mark | the bonsai's three pills on a 12-unit grid, `currentColor`, in the rail's 20px box | Ethan (ADR-094, amended) |
| Reading tools at rest | the bookmark alone on `--scrim` (paper at 72%), glyph opaque; clear until the pointer is over the thread's turns, up over 300ms on the strong ease-out; Search unfolds over 220ms on the panel ease, the drawer's slide | Ethan (ADR-143, amended) |
| Reading tools open | `--paper`, solid, over 150ms on the strong ease-out; the list of requests on `--scrim` with an 8px blur | Ethan (ADR-143, amended) |
| Reading tools shadow | `--float-shadow` (`2px 8px 14px -6px` of `--shadow-strong`): down and to the right as the compose box's `--edge-shadow`, none above (ADR-069), scaled to the 34px bar; it passes under the compose box, which stands over the dock | derived (`--edge-shadow`), Ethan |
| Toast | a menu's shape, since both float over the page: `rounded-xl` (8px) corners, 1px `--border`, `--popup-shadow` (`0 8px 24px` of `--shadow-strong`, the catalog Menu's shadow, which the shadcn menu and dialog share); Inter, rule 7, over Sonner's system stack | derived (`.menu`), Ethan |
| Snooze note | the snooze toast's words stay in the bell as a note on the thread, written with the snooze or not at all, and counted read, since its reader is the one who snoozed | Ethan (ADR-128, amended) |
| Dictation warning and picker | a standing warning in the notice's `--warn-bg` and `--warn-ink`, 14px under the header and 14px over the waveform: with the live microphone "Microphone chosen here has to match your OS' chosen Default Audio Input for Speech to Text to work", since the browser's speech service hears only the system's default; in the Demo's simulated recording "Choose Live Playground to test Speech to Text". In the live picker each input says under its name what it does in 12px `--soft-ink`: System Default "Turns speech into text", naming the device it is, the rest "Waveform only" | Ethan |
| Reply stamp | 11px on 16px `--soft-ink`, tabular figures, under the latest settled reply only: "just now", then 20-minute steps; no time on a user's turn | Ethan (ADR-152) |

## Open questions

- The limitation in the words (pillar 29) and the basis lines under a step's outcome (pillar 30)
  borrow the stopped reply's rule and the narration's type rather than values of their own: keep
  them, or pick a look for each (Ethan's call).

- Whether the stepped slider, dictation controls, links and the primary button should move from
  olive to ink, so green only appears on button hovers (tracked in `docs/LATER.md`).

- Rules 2 and 3 (and the display ink `#22251e`) rest on how the tint looked on a screen with a
  blue-light filter, which warms dark neutrals: re-check them with the filter off.
- Ethan's warm greys (`#8a8a85`, `#cbcac4`) were picked on the same screen: keep them as deliberate
  choices, or re-pick them with the filter off.
- Where the declared `#111411` near-black green is used (likely the hero background) and where the
  declared soft blue `#95aac8` appears.
